\title{Reattach Unique CTR Identifiers to De-identified Data}
\usage{
ctr_Data_reid(box_path, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{box_path}{A character string specifying the root directory path (e.g., your Box folder).
This should be the base path that contains the "DMAC/Data Anonymized/IDs" subdirectory.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing a column \code{id}, which includes the de-identified CTR IDs
that need to be mapped back to their corresponding \code{record_id} and \code{unique_ctr_id}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the original \code{data}, now augmented with \code{record_id} and
\code{unique_ctr_id} columns. These are relocated to immediately follow the \code{id} column.
}
\description{
This function re-identifies CTR records by joining them with the original mapping of
\code{id} to \code{record_id} and \code{unique_ctr_id}. It assumes these mappings are stored as RDS
files in a standardized "IDs" folder.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item Loads all ID mapping files from the specified directory
\item Filters the ID mappings to only those present in the provided \code{data}
\item Merges the filtered ID mappings back into \code{data} using a left join on \code{id}
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
box_path <- "/Users/you/Box/"
deid_data <- readRDS("path/to/deidentified_data.rds")
reid_data <- ctr_Data_reid(box_path, deid_data)
}

}
